  /**
   * The page replacement algorithm for the memory management sumulator.
   * This method gets called whenever a page needs to be replaced.
   * <p>
   * The page replacement algorithm included with the simulator is 
   * FIFO (first-in first-out).  A while or for loop should be used 
   * to search through the current memory contents for a canidate 
   * replacement page.  In the case of FIFO the while loop is used 
   * to find the proper page while making sure that virtPageNum is 
   * not exceeded.
   * <pre>
   *   Page page = ( Page ) mem.elementAt( oldestPage )
   * </pre>
   * This line brings the contents of the Page at oldestPage (a 
   * specified integer) from the mem vector into the page object.  
   * Next recall the contents of the target page, replacePageNum.  
   * Set the physical memory address of the page to be added equal 
   * to the page to be removed.
   * <pre>
   *   controlPanel.removePhysicalPage( oldestPage )
   * </pre>
   * Once a page is removed from memory it must also be reflected 
   * graphically.  This line does so by removing the physical page 
   * at the oldestPage value.  The page which will be added into 
   * memory must also be displayed through the addPhysicalPage 
   * function call.  One must also remember to reset the values of 
   * the page which has just been removed from memory.
   *
   * @param mem is the vector which contains the contents of the pages 
   *   in memory being simulated.  mem should be searched to find the 
   *   proper page to remove, and modified to reflect any changes.  
   * @param virtPageNum is the number of virtual pages in the 
   *   simulator (set in Kernel.java).  
   * @param replacePageNum is the requested page which caused the 
   *   page fault.  
   * @param controlPanel represents the graphical element of the 
   *   simulator, and allows one to modify the current display.
